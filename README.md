BlogDB
======

Why?
----

I want to learn how lexers, parsers, interpreters are built. I also want to learn about how DBs work under the hood. The best way to learn about both? Build your own DB with custom SQL-like query language.

Also, some good blog posts will come out of this, **hopefully**.

Topics of interest:
-------------------

Language topics:

- backtracking parsers
- symbol tables
- AST visitor interpreters 
- stack or register based VMs
	- memory allocation and deallocation

DB topics:

- file systems
- fast data fetching (b-trees)
- I don't know anything about this section, that's the point

There's enough work for 5-10 years here.
