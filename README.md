Why?
----

I want to learn how lexers, parsers, interpreters are built and how certain language features work under the hood, by implementing them myself.

I also want to learn about how DBs work under the hood.

The best way to learn about both? Build your own DB with custom SQL-like query language.

Topics of interest:
-------------------

Langs:

- backtracking parsers
- symbol tables
- visitor interpreters 
- stack or register based VMs
	- memory allocation and deallocation
- green threads
- schedulers

DBs:

- file systems
- fast data fetching (b-trees)
- I don't know anything about this section, that's the point

There's enough work for 5-10 years here.
