Why?
----

I want to learn how lexers, parsers, interpreters and compilers are built and how certain language features work under the hood, by implementing them myself.

Topics of interest:

- backtracking parsers
- symbol tables
- visitor interpreters 
- stack or register based VMs
	- memory allocation and deallocation
- green threads
- schedulers

There's enough work for 5 years here.
